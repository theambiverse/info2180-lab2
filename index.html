    <h2> The Lure of Short Stories</h2>
    <h6>October 2, 2020 by Nikita Clemetson</h6>
    <img src="undraw_book_lover_mkck.png">
    <p>Since the beginning of my writing journey, I have always believed that writing long full-length novels with a brigade of characters and plot points was the only way to do it. And I mean stories that have it all. The type you would see a sophisticate-looking author in a primly 
        pressed-suit sign with an air of importance as a winding line of avid reads waited to get their own copies of the best-selling book inked. 
    </p>
    
    <p>That was what I thought until I took the Introduction to Creative Writing course in my first year second semester. The Poetry module was a pleasant surprise that had me looking forward to the next poem we would read, the next poem would write, 
        and listening to the masterpieces my classmates would come up with. Then there was the Playwriting module (there was never any hope for it). And when the Prose module began, I was ready to exceed the word limit and write to my heart’s content but found my self sticking to 
        the limits. Why you ask? Because my eyes had been opened to the wonder and power of just a few words. “She turned slowly only to find her worse nightmare kneeling with a glistening diamond ring.” That was a story, and it only took you a second to read. It is left you curious hasn’t it? Who is she? Why is her worse nightmare holding a ring? But just as it had begun, it had ended but for that second you were entertained.
    </p><p>So though there is still a part of me that yearns the write those sophisticated novels, I have found myself appreciating the novel (see what I did there?) simplicity of a story, that starts abruptly and ends just as fast, more and more.

    <h2> Bitten by Python</h2>
    <h6>September 2, 2020 by Nikita Clemetson</h6>
    
    <p>The wild python is something to tame. It takes time and effort, but it is possible. The scales and depth of the beast’s skin might seem scary but those are just to intimidate you. Once you have figured out the surface you will see that it is a reptile like any other. The scales protect it from harm, keeping out all those that would try to get rid of it. </p>
<p>Then you will take a closer look. The teeth are scary too, right? But what if I told you that those too are only for show? Yes, it might bite you but there is no venom. Once you have tamed it, learned how to handle it, the python cannot and won’t bite (ok maybe he’ll nip you here and there). You and the snake both will see that you are not prey; that you are its master. </p>

<p>But then you will take it all in. Are you really just noticing its size now? The python is big, and it will continue to grow. But there is no need for alarm for so will you. You will grow to match your python, and maybe you will grow even bigger! </p>
<p>And then you’ll look around and see that you are in the habitat of this thing you once fear. So I say to you, “What do you fear? Go learn how to code in Python.” </p>
